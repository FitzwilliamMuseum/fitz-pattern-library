            Hi, I'm Carmen Pryce, and this is “In my mind's eye: The museum explored”

            a podcast where I talked to artists and writers during lock down about their memories of the Fitzwilliam Museum, part of the University of Cambridge. At the outset of this project, we sent each contributor a brief

            author, playwright, academic and journalist. Ali Smith, who is a regular visitor to the museum, got the concept so quickly she'd written, recorded and, delivered the piece you're about to hear before I'd managed to set up the remote recording

            Ali’s memories, take her on an imaginary tour of the museum and lead her to a small painting by French 19th century artists Henri Fantin Latour in Gallery five.

            Now at the time, UK social distancing guidelines prohibit the meeting off various household indoors. So even though the distance between all of us is a five minute cycle ride and I could have done the interview over the garden gate. The recording takes place online to comply with the rules.

                going straight up to someone you love and giving them the biggest, tightest hug and kiss and sitting down together at the table and someone unthinkingly getting a clatter of cups and plates out, scattering them over it reaching to put a kettle on.

                I've dreamed versions of all these things well, okay, except the Monroes.

                But in one of my many lock down reveries, I also find myself unexpectedly wandering the painting galleries of the venerable Fitzwilliam Museum in Cambridge.
            </li>
            <li>
                00:02:38 - 00:02:44<br>
                <span class="badge bg-dark p-2">Ali Smith</span>
                Just me on my own, loping along past picture after picture on the way to one particular picture.
            </li>
            <li>
                00:02:45 - 00:02:47<br>
                <span class="badge bg-dark p-2">Ali Smith</span>
                I mean, imagine

            <li>
                00:02:48 - 00:03:02<br>
                <span class="badge bg-dark p-2">Ali Smith</span>
                the whole painting gallery all to myself before covid. That's the kind of thing that would have sounded like a paradise, a gallery all to yourself  A kind of thing. Only kings and queens and sultans and Popes and rich chair people on the boards of galleries have.
            </li>
            <li>
                00:03:03 - 00:03:14<br>
                <span class="badge bg-dark p-2">Ali Smith</span>
                And, of course, the cleaners of and the security people working in those galleries and museums. In other words, all the people who form the real infrastructure of this country.
            </li>
            <li>
                00:03:14 - 00:03:20<br>

                The people coronavirus has made more visible than they were before to anybody and more demonstrably necessary.
            </li>
            <li>
                00:03:23 - 00:03:24<br>
                <span class="badge bg-dark p-2">Ali Smith</span>
                Why the Fitzwilliam?

            <li>
                00:03:24 - 00:03:30<br>
                <span class="badge bg-dark p-2">Ali Smith</span>
                I think probably because it belongs to a time when I wasn't quite myself when I was still learning who I might be.
            </li>
            <li>
                00:03:31 - 00:03:34<br>
                <span class="badge bg-dark p-2">Ali Smith</span>
                When I first arrived in the city as a post grad. In 1985
            </li>

                00:03:35 - 00:03:43<br>
                <span class="badge bg-dark p-2">Ali Smith</span>
                I had a room in a tiny cottage down a very small street, about 30 seconds walk from the surreal hugeness, the palatial frontage of the Fitzwilliam
            </li>
            <li>
                00:03:44 - 00:04:12<br>
                <span class="badge bg-dark p-2">Ali Smith</span>
                and it was a place which was free to visit. So I go there a lot when my older sister, who still lives in the highlands near Inverness, where we're from, came to stay with me in the first few weeks of me living down there in England, she and I went to the Fitzwilliam together, spent a Sunday wandering the painting galleries, her seeing enlightened, clever things about the colours of the walls on which the paintings were hung and commenting on the happy face of the baby in one of the Madonna and child paintings. Look that babies just been fed, she said.
            </li>
            <li>
                00:04:13 - 00:04:15<br>
                <span class="badge bg-dark p-2">Ali Smith</span>
                Anyway, that was the reality. Then
            </li>
            <li>
                00:04:16 - 00:04:17<br>
                <span class="badge bg-dark p-2">Ali Smith</span>
                realities change.
            </li>
            <li>
                00:04:18 - 00:04:25<br>
                <span class="badge bg-dark p-2">Ali Smith</span>
                The reality now is that my sister lives at the other end of the country up there in Scotland, so we won't see each other in person for some time.
            </li>
            <li>
                00:04:28 - 00:04:29<br>
                <span class="badge bg-dark p-2">Ali Smith</span>
                Back to the dream. Then
            </li>
            <li>
                00:04:29 - 00:04:56<br>
                <span class="badge bg-dark p-2">Ali Smith</span>
                what was there looking for a running from room to art filled room, not the suits of armour I’d run right past them. Nothing in Egyptology stopped me, not the beautiful ceramics. No, I was up among the paintings I had stopped for breath in front of some billowing fleshy horses and men Rubens. The Death of Hippolytus. A man unseated by a monster as he drove his chariot along the beach and I was standing feeling my own dream lungs thinking about crowds on the beach, shaking my dream head
            </li>
            <li>
                00:04:57 - 00:05:05<br>
                <span class="badge bg-dark p-2">Ali Smith</span>
                above all God, how unexpectedly miserable to be the only person ricocheting around a huge museum.
            </li>
            <li>
                00:05:06 - 00:05:27<br>
                <span class="badge bg-dark p-2">Ali Smith</span>
                What I was wishing for was a room full of people. What I longed for was for something of the old world something jostlingly alive folk wandering and chatting amongst the pictures and the artefacts, all traversing the same space randomly together. I mean, what a luxury to be rubbing shoulders in our old, glorious, messy way up against each other in the art. Who knew how fine that had been.
            </li>
            <li>
                00:05:28 - 00:05:29<br>
                <span class="badge bg-dark p-2">Ali Smith</span>
                Well, we did now,
            </li>
            <li>
                00:05:31 - 00:06:25<br>
                <span class="badge bg-dark p-2">Ali Smith</span>
                Okay, maybe by the time and got to the end of the dream, I'd find more people. Maybe that's what I was looking for on I went I surprised myself by breezing right past things I love like the cool perfection in minutes Domiziano’s Annunciation and look. I was also passing without stopping. How was that possible? One of my favourite paintings ever. The small, bright golden panel by Giovanni Di Paolo of St Bartholomew, standing in Golden Light, graciously holding his book and his knife. He holds these things symbolically because he's the patron saint of leather workers and bookbinders having been skinned alive as his martyrdom. That's how the storey goes, which reminds me of another time back in real life when my partner, Sarah and I were wondering these galleries. It was a Saturday, and it was crowded with people, students, families with kids. And as we passed a crucifixion painting, we also passed a man with a toddler in his arms, maybe three years old,
            </li>
            <li>
                00:06:25 - 00:06:29<br>
                <span class="badge bg-dark p-2">Ali Smith</span>
                and the child was shouting. But why did the people do that to him?
            </li>
            <li>
                00:06:30 - 00:06:30<br>
                <span class="badge bg-dark p-2">Ali Smith</span>
                Why did they
            </li>
            <li>
                00:06:30 - 00:06:51<br>
                <span class="badge bg-dark p-2">Ali Smith</span>
                do it to him? And we all smiled. We all exchanged a look. He raised his eyebrows, the full weight of that innocence in his arms, the heft of every impossible explanation you'd ever have to try to give about the strangeness of the world and the way humans connect to one another on whether gods come into it or not. All of that in his eyes, all in a casual we can visit to the gallery,
            </li>
            <li>
                00:06:53 - 00:07:00<br>
                <span class="badge bg-dark p-2">Ali Smith</span>
                but back in my dream I passed the Cezanne trees blue green blowing in the summer breeze. No, not even them. I was here to see.

            <li>
                00:07:01 - 00:07:01<br>
                <span class="badge bg-dark p-2">Ali Smith</span>
                No,

            <li>
                00:07:02 - 00:07:03<br>

                <span class="badge bg-dark p-2">Ali Smith</span>
                this very small painting.

            <li>
                00:07:12 - 00:07:15<br>
                <span class="badge bg-dark p-2">Ali Smith</span>
                Less than a foot wide between seven or eight inches high.

                That's what I worked my way through this maze of a dream museum to see.

                <span class="badge bg-dark p-2">Ali Smith</span>
                I looked hard at a cup and saucer picture. In my dream.
            </li>
            <li>
                00:07:44 - 00:07:47<br>
                <span class="badge bg-dark p-2">Ali Smith</span>
                That picture finally woke me.

                early in the dark for a bit. Then I got up. Put the light on, open my computer and looked the picture up online to have a less dreamlike look at it.
            </li>
            <li>
                00:08:02 - 00:08:05<br>
                <span class="badge bg-dark p-2">Ali Smith</span>

                or the table is dark and the cup is bright. In this, it's a marriage of dark and light. It's a picture of light in the dark and vice versa

                about the forms light and dark can take when they come together and have a kind of night vision, a way of seeing that lights up and darkens the smallness and the hugeness of our lives

                <span class="badge bg-dark p-2">Ali Smith</span>
                and literally. All it is is a picture of a cup

                but latest coming from somewhere enough. Light to catch in a couple of places on the metal of the spoon, light that makes the porcelain glow as if the cup and the saucer or a kind of ghost vision. Ghostly but not ghoulish. More like a spirit,
            </li>

                of very ordinary everyday metaphysics.

                <span class="badge bg-dark p-2">Ali Smith</span>
                The cup looks both delicate and sturdy. It has a handle that gestures in the mundane elegance of its curve to something slightly more decorative than the cup actually is. In fact, when you spend a bit of time with it, you notice the cup's curve. Hold something angular that suggests it's not simply or smoothly curved. After all, it's more faceted, more unusual than that.

            <li>
                00:09:17 - 00:09:28<br>
                <span class="badge bg-dark p-2">Ali Smith</span>
                Shadow, please, across the surfaces of it and of the saucer turning what looks like they're colourlessness into greys and silvers into something nearer sepia, even a hint of umber.
            </li>
            <li>
                00:09:29 - 00:09:30<br>

                <span class="badge bg-dark p-2">Ali Smith</span>
                though the cup seems to be placed at the centre of the saucer or something about the geometry of the painting makes it look as if it's floating or off centre, impossibly balanced. Sure enough, everything in the picture is slightly offset, pulling towards the left of the frame. The light is offset by the dark, the dark by the light, and when you pay a little more attention to that spoon there, too, it looks as if it's metal might actually be visibly bending as you watch

                <span class="badge bg-dark p-2">Ali Smith</span>
                Fantin Latour as my waking self knows specialised in and made a lot of money, choosing to paint pictures. Unlike this one, popular and comforting colourful still lives, which gestured to art of the past. At a time when art was shifting and changing beyond recognition, he did it splendidly painted wildly vibrant overflows of flowers and vases. He's particularly famous for roses in baskets, blooms falling over each other so brilliantly fulsome and simultaneously falling apart, shedding petals as they open that it's as if his flowers are conversing with each other about their own process.

            <li>
                00:10:46 - 00:10:51<br>
                <span class="badge bg-dark p-2">Ali Smith</span>
                He painted plates of fruit with perfect near photographic fuzz blushes on the peaches.
            </li>
            <li>
                00:10:51 - 00:10:59<br>
                <span class="badge bg-dark p-2">Ali Smith</span>
                He also liked to paint his fellow artists, all grouped around each other, examining one of their pals paintings like a reassurance of peer ship.
            </li>
            <li>
                00:10:59 - 00:11:08<br>
                <span class="badge bg-dark p-2">Ali Smith</span>
                He liked to paint the occasional naked nymph for some consciously cliched. Classical seen something gently titillating in a recognisable mood, comforting.
            </li>
            <li>
                00:11:09 - 00:11:15<br>
                <span class="badge bg-dark p-2">Ali Smith</span>
                And he could, in his repertoire, also paint a charming picture of a woman sitting happily alone
            </li>
            <li>
                00:11:15 - 00:11:16<br>
                <span class="badge bg-dark p-2">Ali Smith</span>

            <li>
                00:11:17 - 00:11:24<br>
                <span class="badge bg-dark p-2">Ali Smith</span>
                In other words, he was an artist who understood comforts. He understood colourfulness and vibrancy.
            </li>
            <li>
                00:11:24 - 00:11:27<br>
                <span class="badge bg-dark p-2">Ali Smith</span>
                He understood solitude and sociability.

                00:11:28 - 00:11:32<br>
                <span class="badge bg-dark p-2">Ali Smith</span>
                He understood to be unexpected narratives that a still life can hold

                00:11:33 - 00:11:37<br>
                <span class="badge bg-dark p-2">Ali Smith</span>
                and pretty much subconsciously subterraneanly Express.

            <li>
                00:11:39 - 00:11:43<br>
                <span class="badge bg-dark p-2">Ali Smith</span>
                And then he goes and paints a nocturne Still life or two like the one My Dream Self had gone for
            </li>
            <li>
                00:11:44 - 00:11:52<br>
                <span class="badge bg-dark p-2">Ali Smith</span>
                what kind of picture? Quite unlike his other work, where light and dark create something so ordinary looking and yet so blastingly uncanny.
            </li>
            <li>
                00:11:53 - 00:12:04<br>
                <span class="badge bg-dark p-2">Ali Smith</span>
                This is like a prophecy in itself, a reminder to everyone who sees it of the strangeness all through our lives and off her fragile and tough and surreal. Everything that's everyday to us can be.

            <li>

                <span class="badge bg-dark p-2">Ali Smith</span>
                The realities are immutable, mysterious that the fixed and familiar things of our lives might well, if we pay them the right attention,
            </li>
            <li>
                00:12:14 - 00:12:20<br>
                <span class="badge bg-dark p-2">Ali Smith</span>
                reveal themselves to be on the one hand spiritually lit and then the other already in melt down,
            </li>
            <li>
                00:12:22 - 00:12:25<br>
                <span class="badge bg-dark p-2">Ali Smith</span>
                I'd like to see more clearly what they really mean to us.

                <span class="badge bg-dark p-2">Ali Smith</span>
                I sat on the edge of my bed and thought of the way that this tiny, glowing and haunting painting, ostensibly of a momentary nothing in life was really on everything
            </li>
            <li>
                00:12:37 - 00:13:01<br>
                <span class="badge bg-dark p-2">Ali Smith</span>
                I thought about how it had surfaced for me. Now, as a worker at the heart of a grand and renowned collection, it sits there black and white and all grey area, quiet and simple and haunting beyond belief on the wall of the grandest edifice, full of the artefacts and trappings of centuries of history and money and culture, and gain and loss and myth making and imperialism
            </li>
            <li>
                00:13:01 - 00:13:15<br>
                <span class="badge bg-dark p-2">Ali Smith</span>
                it haunts. It overturns everything in the museum, even the place itself, with its quiet demand that we pay attention to the detail of our lives that we meditatively evaluate what matters.
            </li>
            <li>
                00:13:16 - 00:13:21<br>
                <span class="badge bg-dark p-2">Ali Smith</span>
                It asks in our encounter with the dark the light. Our own, uncanny every day

            <li>
                00:13:22 - 00:13:32<br>
                <span class="badge bg-dark p-2">Ali Smith</span>
                we come to understand, have a re seeing of the familiar from a new perspective. See the perspective of this unlikely and changed world we never thought to find yourselves in

                <span class="badge bg-dark p-2">Ali Smith</span>
                might unsettle us richly as well as strangely,

                and talked about my

                journey, My arrival in Cambridge, my departure from from New York, where I had been looking after ceramics and how in a way that painting represented the the place I was going.
            </li>
            <li>
                00:15:49 - 00:16:08<br>
                <span class="badge bg-dark p-2">Luke Syson</span>
                And I think it does have that quality. There's a wonderful story that I was once told about another novelist, Anita Brookner, who met somebody at Liverpool Street Station and when she was asked where she was going she said. I'm going to Cambridge to see Fantin Latour’s Cup and Saucer
            </li>
            <li>
                00:16:09 - 00:16:12<br>
                <span class="badge bg-dark p-2">Luke Syson</span>
                Ond, they said, And then what? And then she said, I'm going to come home
            </li>
            <li>
                00:16:13 - 00:16:21<br>
                <span class="badge bg-dark p-2">Luke Syson</span>
                So it's a sort of sense somehow that it's a very complete experience of, ah, picture that that
            </li>
            <li>
                00:16:22 - 00:16:28<br>
                <span class="badge bg-dark p-2">Luke Syson</span>
                imprints itself on our memories on that somehow stands for much more

            <li>
                00:16:28 - 00:16:30<br>
                <span class="badge bg-dark p-2">Luke Syson</span>
                than it is. And I think that's what
            </li>
            <li>
                00:16:31 - 00:16:41<br>
                <span class="badge bg-dark p-2">Luke Syson</span>
                Smith has so brilliantly encapsulated. My space. That's what this picture has been for me as I thought about coming to Cambridge, and now that I'm there,
            </li>

                <span class="badge bg-dark p-2">Carmen Pryce/ Jane Munro</span>
                Jane, as curator, Do you have anything to add to that? It's a painting I've known for virtually all my curatorial life and again and again. It's a painting that
            </li>

                <span class="badge bg-dark p-2">Jane Munro</span>
                less seduces people but draws people in and draws of narratives. It's understated. That's unassuming, but it's got the song with sort of hypnotic, great white greyish whiteness that
            </li>

                invites you into this sort of say crawl, light and ambience that it exudes. And, like Ali Smith takes us on a journey. It leaves room for the imagination to grow in so many ways in so many directions. How do you feel about the reading? What seems to me brilliant in her selection, and in her reading

                <span class="badge bg-dark p-2">Jane Munro</span>
                is that she
            </li>
            <li>
                00:17:30 - 00:17:37<br>
                <span class="badge bg-dark p-2">Jane Munro</span>
                brings out through the sort of unfussyness and the elemental simplicity of this painting, the brilliant way it's being painted,
            </li>
            <li>
                00:17:38 - 00:17:44<br>
                <span class="badge bg-dark p-2">Jane Munro</span>
                that she brings out something that we've all been feeling to some degree during the pandemic.

                <span class="badge bg-dark p-2">Jane Munro</span>
                And that is a strange sense of isolation at the same time as being in the presence ofthe
            </li>
            <li>
                00:17:54 - 00:18:11<br>
                <span class="badge bg-dark p-2">Jane Munro</span>
                other people, other objects, other stories. She talks at one point about Fantin’s solitude and sociability, and these two things go really very well. Hand and hand in her piece, she takes us wandering through the museum
            </li>
            <li>
                00:18:11 - 00:18:14<br>
                <span class="badge bg-dark p-2">Jane Munro</span>
                and actually what I find personally

            <li>
                00:18:14 - 00:18:33<br>
                <span class="badge bg-dark p-2">Jane Munro</span>
                extremely moving was the way she talks about being separated from people and places that she cares about and means a great deal to her. And that may be because I'm from the same part of the world, is her.
            </li>
            <li>
                00:18:33 - 00:18:50<br>
                <span class="badge bg-dark p-2">Jane Munro</span>
                I can see it as a place that's far away and has been unreachable when I most want to be near it in this period, and I think a feeling that a lot of us will have had in the last few weeks and months.
            </li>
            <li>
                00:18:50 - 00:18:54<br>
                <span class="badge bg-dark p-2">Luke Syson</span>
                There's something too about the the cup, the painting

                00:18:55 - 00:19:09<br>
                <span class="badge bg-dark p-2">Luke Syson</span>
                of a cup that makes it so much more than a cup and saucer. Also, I think the other thing that's marvellous about how Ali Smith’s piece and about the painting itself is that it implies the presence of somebody.

                <span class="badge bg-dark p-2">Luke Syson</span>
                The cup can be filled and it's ready to be used because that spoon is there. So it implies,  as Jane says, a kind of

                very mysterious because there's no context for the cart. There's no descriptive detail around it. No cloth, no flowers. The cake, No tea indeed, on and. so it's

                waiting for something to happen on. You wait with it. It has that expectant quality, and it has that sense that that a human being, well, several human beings are involved in some form of transaction that Fantin is controlling. It makes it into a kind of cup that

            <li>
                00:19:59 - 00:20:19<br>
                <span class="badge bg-dark p-2">Luke Syson</span>
                is, as I think, Janey just used the word elemental, but it's the sort of essence of cup. Fantin creates a cup that has that sense of being an absolute truth that the idea of the cup as well as a real thing. That's a very powerful

                idea because it is, as it were, encapsulated all that is a cup

                And all the association's we have with that simple, mundane object

                00:20:33 - 00:20:39<br>
                <span class="badge bg-dark p-2">Jane Munro</span>
                think that's absolutely true. And I guess one of the things that have also fascinated me about

                <span class="badge bg-dark p-2">Jane Munro</span>
                well, about the very fascination that this painting holes is that there's another picture in the Fitzwilliam of, a white candle stick

                engagement. In some ways, it's a beautiful thing. It's the same sort of palette. It's white colour that Fantin excels and whether it's in in the dress off one of his sitters in the portrait's whether it's in any number of flowers that he paints. Lily's narcissi poppies lilacs larkspurs
