# Introduction

This pattern library covers the HTML/CSS components that we are using for
the Fitzwilliam Museum's products:

* Main website
* Collections Explorer
* All other web products

This was part of the FitzVirtual project, that was instigated during the
CoronaVirus pandemic lockdown and is a new direction for the museum's digital presence. The entire digital presence has been constructed by Daniel Pett. 

The library is produced using the Astrum package and provides example components and HTML source code.
