# Fitzwilliam Museum Patterns Library

This repository contains the code to run an Astrum pattern library. This source project is obsolete, but still produces great results and I have continued with this rather than a javascript driven project just to be stubborn.

To get this working is quite simple, follow the [documentation](https://github.com/NoDivide/astrum) provided by the package creator.

## Running the package

This is best done on a webserver so that you don't get CORS errors and nothing loading. We have deployed direct to gh-pages using the docs folder.

## Adding new components

After you have installed the npm package and changed directory to the project, simply run:

```bash
astrum astrum new path/to/component
```

Follow the prompts and away you go.
