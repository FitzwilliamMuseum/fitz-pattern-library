# Introduction

This pattern library covers the HTML/CSS components that we are using for
the @FitzwilliamMuseum's Beta products:

This is part of the FitzVirtual project, that has been instigated during the
CoronaVirus pandemic lockdown and is a new direction for the museum's digital presence.

The library is produced using the Astrum package and provides example components and HTML source code.
