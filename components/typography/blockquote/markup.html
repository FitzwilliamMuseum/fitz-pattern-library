    George Pinto was an undergraduate at Trinity College, Cambridge, just a
    stoneâ€™s throw from the Fitzwilliam, and he was always a generous supporter
    of the Fitz through his membership of our Marlay Group. Now, thanks to his
    life-long connoisseurship, and of course the entirely admirable Acceptance
    in Lieu Scheme, these lively, delicate works now come to the Fitz for our
    public to enjoy for generations to come.
