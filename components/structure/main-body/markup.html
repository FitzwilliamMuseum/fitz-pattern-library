    The museum has now re-opened and we look forward to welcoming you back. Our
    regular visitors may notice some differences to what is on offer to families.
    Currently Fitz Kits, activity boxes, story starters, drawing materials and
    our baby play mat are not available to borrow. We do have free family
    trails but we suggest bringing your own paper and pencils if you want to
    draw in the gallery.
